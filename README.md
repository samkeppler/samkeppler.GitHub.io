## My dataset example is The US Census Bureau. ## 
This dataset has a vast number of applications, but I will focus on my personal experience with it. I used this dataset
frequently in my prior job as a legal consultant when I would conduct public opinion
research in jurisdiction areas. In the legal field, this dataset is very important on the
individual level because it allows you to find correlations between a person’s
demographic information (gender, age, occupation, socioeconomic status, etc.) and their
political and ethical beliefs so that you can relatively accurately select jurors who will
favor your case in jury selection. It is also helpful on the legal research level because it
allows you to create recruit quotas so that you can find a representative sample that is
demographically matched to your jurisdiction area, which therefore strengthens the
validity of your findings.
## My data science book is *Genetic Algorithms and Evolutionary Computation* by Adam Marczyk. ## 
The book was published by The TalkOrigins Archive in 2004. ## This book caught my eye because I
dabbled in evolutionary psychology during my undergrad and I was fascinated about how
deeply mathematical the field can be. The title itself also fascinates me because it seems
to be combining the study of genetics, one of the blooming science fields of the future,
with evolution, the field where we examine mankind’s past. I would be interested in
reading this book and getting a more comprehensive and integrated approach on
evolution, as well as the roles that math and data science play in the modernization of the
field.
